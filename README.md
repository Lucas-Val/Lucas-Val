# Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m Lucas, a **data & learning enthusiast**.
I enjoy exploring how data can tell stories, solve problems, and open up new ways of thinking.  
Data is what turns opinion into clarity, and information into insight that empowers teams to act with confidence.  

ðŸ”Ž A few things about me:  
- ðŸ“Š Learning and experimenting with **R, SQL, and all things analytics**  
- ðŸŽ“ Masterâ€™s student in **Data Science**  
- ðŸŒ± Lifelong learner, always chasing new ideas and skills

ðŸ“Œ This GitHub is where I share projects, practice code, and document my learning journey in data science.
